 Defensive Programming,D.14,HR,HR,Yes,"Defensive programming is more a \
component or a programming activity than an architecture activity per se, \
but as it is recorded in this table, it's worth mentioning that the Ada \
language provides several features addressing various objectives of \
defensive programming techniques (e.g., exception handling). In addition, \
the GNAT Static Analysis Suite and SPARK tools help identify pieces of code \
that should be protected by defensive code."
 Fault Detection & Diagnosis,D.26,R,R,No,
 Error Correcting Codes,D.19,|mdash|,|mdash|,No,
 Error Detecting Codes,D.19,R,HR,No,
 Failure Assertion Programming,D.24,R,HR,Yes,"The Ada language allows formalizing \
assertions and contracts in various places in the code."
 Safety Bag Techniques,D.47,R,R,No,
 Diverse Programming,D.16,R,HR,Yes,"Using Ada along with another language \
and a different code generation technology can be used to contribute to the \
diverse programming argument."
 Recovery Block,D.44,R,R,No,
 Backward Recovery,D.5,NR,NR,No,
 Forward Recovery,D.30,NR,NR,No,
 Retry Fault Recovery Mechanisms,D.46,R,R,No,
 Memorising Executed Cases,D.36,R,HR,No,
 Artificial Intelligence – Fault Correction,D.1,NR,NR,No,
 Dynamic Reconfiguration of software,D.17,NR,NR,No,
 Software Error Effect Analysis,D.25,R,HR,No,
 Graceful Degradation,D.31,R,HR,No,
 Information Hiding / Encapsulation,D.33,HR,HR,Yes,"The Ada language \
provides the necessary features to separate the interface of a module \
from its implementation and enforce this separation."
 Fully Defined Interface,D.38,HR,M,Yes,"The Ada language provides the \
necessary features to separate the interface of a module from its \
implementation and enforce this separation."
 Formal Methods,D.28,R,HR,Yes,"SPARK can be used to formally define \
architectural properties, such as data flow, directly in the code and \
provides the means to verify them."
 Modeling,Table A.17,R,HR,Yes,"Ada and SPARK allow defining certain \
modeling properties in the code and provide means to verify them."
 Structured Methodology,D.52,HR,HR,Yes,"Structured Methodology designs \
can be implemented with Ada."
 Modeling supported by computer aided design and specification tools,Table A.17,R,HR,No,
