 Technique/Measure,Ref,SIL 2,SIL 3/4,Covered,Comment
 Formal Methods,D.28,R,HR,Yes,"Component requirements and interfaces \
can be written in the form of formal boolean properties, using the \
Ada or SPARK languages. These properties are verifiable."
 Modeling,Table A.17,HR,HR,Yes,"Ada and SPARK allow defining certain \
modeling properties in the code and provide means to verify them."
 Structured methodology,D.52,HR,HR,Yes,"Structured Methodology designs \
can be implemented with Ada."
 Modular Approach,D.38,M,M,Yes,"A module can be represented as an Ada \
package, with a cohesive and well-defined functionality, a clear \
external interface in the visible part of the package spec, a private \
part whose visibility is limited to to its child units, and a body \
containing the implementation (which is only visible to its subunits)."
 Components,Table A.20,HR,HR,Yes,"A component can be defined as a set \
of Ada packages, which can clearly define the interface to access the \
internal data, and the interfaces can be fully and unambiguously defined. \
This set of packages is typically identified within a project file \
(GPR file) and can be put into a version control system."
  Design and Coding Standards,Table A.12,HR,M,Yes,"There are available \
references for the coding standard. Verification can be automated in \
different ways: the GNAT compiler can define base coding standard rules \
to be checked at compile-time, with GNATcheck implementing a wider range of \
rules."
 Analyzable Programs,D.2,HR,HR,Yes,"The Ada language provide native \
features to improve program analysis, such as type ranges, parameter modes, \
and encapsulation. Tools such as GNATmetric and GNATcheck can help monitor \
the complexity of the code and prevent the use of overly complex code. \
GNAT SAS allows making an assessment of program analyzability during its \
development. For higher SILs, the use of SPARK ensures that the subset \
of the language used is suitable for most the rigorous analysis."
 Strongly Typed Programming Language,D.49,HR,HR,Yes,"Ada is a strongly typed \
language."
 Structured Programming,D.53,HR,HR,Yes,"Ada supports all the usual paradigms \
of structured programming. In addition, GNATcheck can control additional \
design properties, such as explicit control flows, where subprograms have \
single entry and single exit points, and structural complexity is reduced."
 Programming Language,Table A.15,HR,HR,Yes,"Ada can be used for most of the \
development, while facilitating interfacing to other languages such as \
C or assembly."
 Language Subset,D.35,|mdash|,HR,Yes,"Ada is designed to support \
subsetting, possibly under the control of specific runtimes, GNATcheck, or \
with SPARK. Another possibility is to follow the recommendations in \
:cite:`Railway_SW_ISO_IEC_1998`."
 Object-Oriented Programming,"Table A.22, D.57",R,R,Yes,"If needed, Ada \
supports all the usual paradigms of object-oriented programming, in addition \
to safety-related features such as the :index:`Liskov Substitution Principle`."
 Procedural Programming,D.60,HR,HR,Yes,"Ada supports all the usual paradigms \
of procedural programming."
Metaprogramming,D.59,R,R,No,
