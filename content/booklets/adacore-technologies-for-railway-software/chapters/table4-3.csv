 Technique/Measure,Ref,SIL 2,SIL 3/4,Covered,Comment
 Formal Proof,D.29,R,HR,Yes,"When Ada pre- and post-conditions are used, \
together with the SPARK subset of the language, formal methods can formally \
verify compliance of the implementation with these contracts."
 Static Analysis,Table A.19,HR,HR,Yes,See Table A.19
 Dynamic Analysis and Testing,Table A.13,HR,HR,Yes,See Table A.13
 Metrics,D.37,R,R,Yes,"GNATmetric can compute and report metrics, such as \
code size, comment percentage, cyclomatic complexity, unit nesting, and \
loop nesting. These can then be compared with standards."
 Traceability,D.58,HR,M,No,
 Software Error Effect Analysis,D.25,R,HR,Yes,"GNAT Studio supports code \
display and navigation. GNAT SAS can identify likely error locations in the \
code. This supports potential software error detection and analysis \
throughout the code."
 Test Coverage for code,Table A.21,HR,HR,Yes,See Table A.21
 Functional / Black-Box Testing,Table A.14,HR,HR,Yes,See Table A.14
 Performance Testing,Table A.18,HR,HR,No,
 Interface Testing,D.34,HR,HR,Yes,"Ada's strong typing, together with \
its contract-based programming support, provides increased assurance to \
demonstrate that the software interfaces are correct. This can help \
improve software-to-software integration testing."
