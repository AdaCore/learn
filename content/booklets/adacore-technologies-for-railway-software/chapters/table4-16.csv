 Technique/Measure,Ref,SIL 2,SIL 3/4,Covered,Comment
 Boundary Value Analysis,D.4,R,HR,Yes,"GNAT SAS can compute boundary values \
for variables and parameters from the source code. GNAT SAS and SPARK can \
verify various properties by analyzing potential values and boundary values \
of variables. This includes detecting errors such as dereferencing a pointer \
that could be null, generating a value outside the bounds of an Ada type or \
subtype, violating a memory safety constraint (`buffer overrun`), \
generating a numeric overflow or wraparound, and dividing by zero. \
GNAT SAS and SPARK also help to confirm expected boundary values of \
variables and parameters coming from the design."
 Checklists,D.7,R,R,No,
 Control Flow Analysis,D.8,HR,HR,Yes,"GNAT SAS and SPARK can detect \
suspicious and potentially incorrect control flows, such as unreachable \
code, redundant conditionals, loops that either run forever or fail to \
terminate normally, and subprograms that never return. GNATstack can analyze \
control flow and compute the maximum amount of stack memory for each task. \
More generally, GNAT Studio provides visualization for call graphs and \
call trees."
 Data Flow Analysis,D.10,HR,HR,Yes,"GNAT SAS and SPARK can detect suspicious \
and potentially incorrect data flow, such as variables being read before \
they are written (uninitialized variables), and values that are written to \
variables without being read (redundant assignments)."
 Error Guessing,D.20,R,R,Yes,"Although realized through dynamic rather than \
static analysis, GNAT fuzz can automatically generate test cases to \
support Error Guessing."
 Walkthroughs/Design Reviews,D.56,HR,HR,Yes, "GNAT Studio can display \
and navigate the code, supporting walkthrough activities."
