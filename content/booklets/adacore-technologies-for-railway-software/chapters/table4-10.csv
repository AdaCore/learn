 Coding Standard,D.15,HR,M,Yes,"GNATcheck allows implementing and verifying \
a coding standard."
 Coding Style Guide,D.15,HR,HR,Yes,"GNATcheck allows implementing and verifying \
a coding style guide."
 No Dynamic Objects,D.15,R,HR,Yes,"GNATcheck can forbid the use of dynamic \
objects."
 No Dynamic Variables,D.15,R,HR,Yes,"GNATcheck can forbid the use of dynamic \
variables."
 Limited Use of Pointers,D.15,R,R,Yes,"GNATcheck can forbid the use of \
pointers or force justification of their usage."
 Limited Use of Recursion,D.15,R,HR,Yes,"GNATcheck can forbid the use of \
recursion or force justification of their usage."
 No Unconditional Jumps,D.15,HR,HR,Yes,"GNATcheck can forbid the use of \
unconditional jumps."
 "Limited size and complexity of Functions, Subroutines and \
Methods",D.38,HR,HR,Yes,"GNATmetric can compute complexity measures, and \
GNATcheck can report excessive complexity."
 "Entry/Exit Point strategy for Functions, Subroutines and \
Methods",D.38,HR,HR,Yes,"GNATcheck can verify rules related to exit points."
 Limited number of subroutine parameters,D.38,R,R,Yes,"GNATcheck can limit \
the number of parameters for subroutines and report when that number is \
exceeded."
 Limited use of Global Variables,D.38,HR,M,Yes,"GNATcheck can flag global \
variable usage and enforce their justification. SPARK forbids function \
side effects and enforces documentation and verification of uses of global \
variables. GNAT Studio allows analyzing usage of global variables."
