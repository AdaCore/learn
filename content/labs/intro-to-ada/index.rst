    These labs contain exercises for the
    :doc:`Introduction to Ada </courses/intro-to-ada/index>` course.

    This document was written by Gustavo A. Hoffmann and reviewed by Michael
    Frank.

    .. note::

        The code examples in this course use an 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
