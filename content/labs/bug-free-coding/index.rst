    Workshop project: Learn to write maintainable bug-free code with SPARK Ada.

    This document was written by Robert Tice.

    .. note::

        The code examples in this course use an 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
