What is Ada and SPARK?
-----------------------

Ada is a state-of-the art programming language that development teams worldwide
are using for critical software: from microkernels and small-footprint,
real-time embedded systems to large-scale enterprise applications, and
everything in between.

SPARK is formally analyzable subset of Ada |mdash| and toolset that brings
mathematics-based confidence to software verification.

Try Ada Now:
-------------

.. code:: ada run_button project=Introduction main=learn.adb

    with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

    procedure Learn is

       subtype Alphabet is Character range 'A' .. 'Z';

    begin

       Put_Line ("Learning Ada from " & Alphabet'First & " to " & Alphabet'Last);

    end Learn;
