+++++++++++++
Description
+++++++++++++

Although the Ravenscar and Jorvik profiles allow the use of shared variables
for inter-task communication, such use is less robust and less reliable than
encapsulating shared variables within protected objects.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Applicable vulnerability within ISO TR 24772-2
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* 6.56 Undefined behaviour [EWF]

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Noncompliant Code Example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. literalinclude:: examples/con03.ads
  :language: Ada
  :lines: 5-7
  :dedent: 3

Note that variables marked as :ada:`Atomic` are also :ada:`Volatile`, per the
`Ada RM C.6/8(3) - Shared Variable Control
<http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/12rm/html/RM-C-6.html>`_

++++++++++++++++++++++++
Compliant Code Example
++++++++++++++++++++++++

When assigned to a memory address, a :ada:`Volatile` variable can be used to
interact with a memory-mapped device, among other similar usages.

Notes
+++++++

In additon to GNATcheck, SPARK and CodePeer can also detect conflicting access
to unprotected variables.
