Description
+++++++++++++

In this approach, class-wide constructs are allowed, as well as tagged types
and type extension (inheritance), but dynamic dispatching remains disallowed
(i.e., as in OOP01).

This rule ensures there are no class-wide values passed as the parameter to a
primitive operation of a tagged type, hence there are no dynamically dispatched
calls.

Note that this rule should not be applied without due consideration.
