+++++++++++++
Description
+++++++++++++

Case statement alternatives and case-expressions must not include use of the
:ada:`others` discrete choice option. This rule prevents accidental coverage
of a choice added after the initial case statement is written, when an explicit
handler was intended for the addition.

Note that this is opposite to typical C guidelines such as [SEI-C]_ MSC01-C.
The reason is that in C, the :c:`default` alternative plays the role of
defensive
code to mitigate the switch statement's non-exhaustivity. In Ada, the
:ada:`case` construct is exhaustive:
the compiler statically verifies that for every possible value of the
:ada:`case` expression there is a branch alternative, and there is also
a dynamic check against invalid values which serves as implicit defensive code;
as a result, Ada's :ada:`others` alternative doesn't play C's defensive code
role and therefore a stronger guideline can be adopted.
