Description

Much like the situation with :ada:`others` in
:ada:`case` statements and :ada:`case`
expressions, the use of :ada:`others` in exception handlers makes it
possible to omit an intended specific handler for an exception, especially
a new exception added to an existing set of handlers. As a result, a
subprogram could return normally without having applied any recovery for
the specific exception occurrence, which is likely a coding error.

Notes
+++++++

ISO TR 24772-2: 6.50.2 slightly contradicts this when applying exception
handlers around calls to library routines:

   * Put appropriate exception handlers in all routines that call library
     routines, including the catch-all exception handler :ada:`when others =>`

   * Put appropriate exception handlers in all routines that are called by
     library routines, including the catch-all exception handler
     :ada:`when others =>`

ISO TR 24772-2 also recommends "All tasks should contain an exception handler
at the outer
level to prevent silent termination due to unhandled exceptions."
