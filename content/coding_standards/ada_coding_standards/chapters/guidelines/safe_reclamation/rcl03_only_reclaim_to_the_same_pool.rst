Description
+++++++++++++

When deallocating, ensure that the pool to which the storage will be returned
was the same pool from which it was allocated. Execution is erroneous
otherwise, meaning anything can happen
(`Ada RM 13.11.2(16) - Unchecked Storage Deallocation
<http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/2xrm/html/RM-13=11-2.html>`_).

Each access type has an associated storage pool, either implicitly by default,
or explicitly with a storage pool specified by the programmer. The implicit
default pool might not be the same pool used for another access type, even an
access type designating the same subtype.

Noncompliant Code Example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: Ada

      type Pointer1 is access all Integer;
      type Pointer2 is access all Integer;
      P1 : Pointer1;
      P2 : Pointer2;
      procedure Free is new Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation
         (Object => Integer, Name => Pointer2);
   begin
      P1 := new Integer;
      P2 := Pointer2 (P1);
      Call_Something ( P2.all );
      ...
      Free (P2);

In the above, :ada:`P1.all` was allocated from :ada:`Pointer1'Storage_Pool`,
but, via the type conversion, the code above is attempting to return it to
:ada:`Pointer2'Storage_Pool`, which may be a different pool.

.. code-block:: Ada

      type Pointer1 is access all Integer;
      type Pointer2 is access all Integer;
      P1 : Pointer1;
      P2 : Pointer2;
      procedure Free is new Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation
         (Object => Integer, Name => Pointer1);
   begin
      P1 := new Integer;
      P2 := Pointer2 (P1);
      Call_Something ( P2.all );
      ...
      Free (P1);

Notes

Enforcement of this rule can only be provided by manual code review, unless
deallocation is forbidden via No_Unchecked_Deallocation.
