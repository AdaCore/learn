`Ada RM H.4 - High Integrity Restrictions
<http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/2xrm/html/RM-H-4.html>`_

+++++++++++++
Description
+++++++++++++

The following restrictions must be in effect:

   * No_Anonymous_Allocators
   * No_Coextensions
   * No_Access_Parameter_Allocators
   * Immediate_Reclamation

The first three restrictions prevent problematic usage that, for example, may
cause un-reclaimed (and unreclaimable) storage. The last restriction ensures
any storage allocated by the compiler at run-time for representing objects is
reclaimed at once. (That restriction does not apply to objects created by
allocators in the application.)

Noncompliant Code Example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For No_Anonymous_Allocators:

   .. code-block:: Ada

      X : access String := new String'("Hello");
      ...
      X := new String'("Hello");

For No_Coextensions:

   .. code-block:: Ada

      type Object (Msg : access String) is ...
      Obj : Object (Msg => new String'("Hello"));

For No_Access_Parameter_Allocators:

   .. code-block:: Ada

      procedure P (Formal : access String);
      ...
      P (Formal => new String'("Hello"));

++++++++++++++++++++++++
Compliant Code Example
++++++++++++++++++++++++

For No_Anonymous_Allocators, use a named access type:

   .. code-block:: Ada

      type String_Reference is access all String;
      S : constant String_Reference := new String'("Hello");
      X : access String := S;
      ...
      X := S;

For No_Coextensions, use a variable of a named access type:

   .. code-block:: Ada

      type Object (Msg : access String) is ...
      type String_Reference is access all String;
      S : String_Reference := new String'("Hello");
      Obj : Object (Msg => S);

For No_Access_Parameter_Allocators, use a variable of a named access type:

   .. code-block:: Ada

      procedure P (Formal : access String);
      type String_Reference is access all String;
      S : String_Reference := new String'("Hello");
      ...
      P (Formal => S);

Notes
+++++++

The compiler will detect violations of the first three restrictions. Note that
GNATcheck can detect violations in addition to the compiler.

The fourth restriction is a directive for implementation behavior, not subject
to source-based violation detection.
