MISRA C Rule 21.3 "The memory allocation and deallocation functions of <stdlib.h>
shall not be used"

+++++++++++++
Description
+++++++++++++

The following restrictions must be in effect:

   * No_Allocators
   * No_Dependence => Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation

In this approach dynamic access values are only created via the attribute
:ada:`'Access` applied to aliased objects. Allocation and deallocation never
occur. As a result, storage exhaustion cannot occur because no *dynamic*
allocations occur. Fragmentation cannot occur because there are no
deallocations.

In this approach the following constructs are not allowed:

   * Allocators
   * User-defined storage pools
   * Unchecked Deallocations

Aspects should be applied to all access types in this approach, specifying a
value of zero for the storage size.  Although the restriction No_Allocators is
present, such clauses may be necessary to prevent any default storage pools
from being allocated for the access types, even though the pools would never be
used. A direct way to accomplish this is to use pragma Default_Storage_Pool
with a parameter of :ada:`null` like so:

.. code:: Ada

   pragma Default_Storage_Pool (null);

The above would also ensure no allocations can occur with access types that
have the default pool as their associated storage pool (per
`Ada RM 13.11.3(6.1/3) - Default Storage Pools
<http://ada-auth.org/standards/12rm/html/RM-13-11-3.html>`_)

The compiler, and/or GNATcheck, will detect violations of the restrictions.
