    This course will teach you advanced topics of SPARK.

    .. note::

        The code examples in this course use an 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.

    .. only:: builder_latex or builder_epub

        .. note::

            Each code example from this book has an associated "code block
            metadata", which contains the name of the "project" and an MD5 hash
            value. This information is used to identify a single code example.

            You can find all code examples in a zip file, which you can
            `download from the learn website <https://learn.adacore.com/zip/learning-ada_code.zip>`_.
            The directory structure in the zip file is based on the code block
            metadata. For example, if you're searching for a code example with
            this metadata:

            - Project: Courses.Intro_To_Ada.Imperative_Language.Greet

            - MD5: cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab

            you will find it in this directory:

            :file:`projects/Courses/Intro_To_Ada/Imperative_Language/Greet/cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab/`

            In order to use this code example, just follow these steps:

            1. Unpack the zip file;
            2. Go to target directory;
            3. Start GNAT Studio on this directory;
            4. Build (or compile) the project;
            5. Run the application (if a main procedure is available in the
               project).
