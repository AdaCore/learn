Test and Proof
=====================================================================

Various Combinations of Tests and Proofs
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Overall context is functional verification of code

- Combination can take various forms:

    - Test before Proof – contracts used first in test, possibly later in
      proof

    - Test for Proof – contracts executed in test to help with development
      of proof

    - Test alongside Proof – some modules are tested and other modules are
      proved

    - Test as Proof – exhaustive test as good as proof

    - Test on top of Proof – proof at unit level completed with test at
      integration level, also using contracts


Test (be)for(e) Proof
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Activating Run-time Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Need to activate run-time checks in executable

- :ada:`Constraint_Error` exceptions activated by default

    - Use ``-gnat-p`` to revert effect of previous ``-gnatp`` (say in
      project file)

    - Use ``-gnato`` to activate overflow checking (default since GNAT
      7.3)

- Special handling of floating-point computations

    - Use ``-gnateF`` to activate bound checking on standard float types

    - Use ``-msse2 -mfpmath=sse`` to forbid use of 80bits registers and
      FMA on x86 processors

    - Runtime/BSP should enforce use of Round-Nearest-tie-to-Even (RNE)
      rounding mode


Activating Assertions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Need to activate assertions in executable

- :ada:`Assertion_Error` exceptions deactivated by default

    - Use ``-gnata`` to activate globally

    - Use pragma :ada:`Assertion_Policy` to activate file-by-file

    - Use ``-gnateE`` to get more precise error messages
      (:ada:`Contract_Cases`)

- Special assertions checked at run time

    - :ada:`Contract_Cases` ⟶ checks one and only one case activated

    - :ada:`Loop_Invariant` ⟶ checks assertion holds (even if not
      inductive)

    - :ada:`Assume` ⟶ checks assertion holds (even if not subject to
      proof)

    - :ada:`Loop_Variant` ⟶ checks variant decreases wrt previous
      iteration


Activating Ghost Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Need to activate ghost code in executable

- Ghost code, like assertions, is deactivated by default

    - Use ``-gnata`` to activate globally

    - Use pragma :ada:`Assertion_Policy (Ghost => Check)` to activate
      locally

- Inconsistent combinations will be rejected by GNAT

    - Ignored ghost entity in activated assertion

    - Ignored ghost assignment to activated ghost variable


Test for Proof
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Overflow Checking Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Problem: ignore overflow checks in assertions/contracts

    - Only applies to signed integer arithmetic

    - Does not apply inside an expression function returning an integer

- Solution: use unbounded arithmetic in assertions/contracts

    - Will use 64bits signed arithmetic when sufficient

    - Otherwise use a run-time library for unbounded arithmetic

- Two ways to activate unbounded arithmetic

    - Use ``-gnato13`` compiler switch

    - Use pragma :ada:`Overflow_Mode` with arguments
      :ada:`(General => Strict, Assertions => Eliminated)` in
      configuration pragma file


Test alongside Proof
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Checking Proof Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Need to check dynamically the assumptions done in proof

    - Postcondition of tested subprogram called in proved subprogram

    - Precondition of proved subprogram called in tested subprogram

- Other assumptions beyond pre- and postconditions

    - Global variables read and written by tested subprogram

    - Non-aliasing of inputs and outputs of proved subprogram

    - No run-time errors in tested subprogram

- GNATprove can list assumptions used in proof

    - Switch ``--assumptions`` adds info in ``gnatprove.out`` file

- See "Explicit Assumptions - A Prenup for Marrying Static and Dynamic
  Program Verification"


Rules for Defining the Boundary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ada:`SPARK_Mode` defines a simple boundary test vs. proof

    - Subprograms with :ada:`SPARK_Mode (On)` should be proved

    - Subprograms with :ada:`SPARK_Mode (Off)` should be tested

- :ada:`SPARK_Mode` can be used at different levels

    - Project-wise switch in configuration pragma file (with value
      :ada:`On`) ⟶ explicit exemptions of units/subprograms in the code

    - Distinct GNAT project with :ada:`SPARK_Mode (On)` for proof on
      subset of units

    - Explicit :ada:`SPARK_Mode (On)` on units that should be proved

- Unproved checks inside proved subprograms are justified

    - Use of pragma :ada:`Annotate` inside the code


Special Compilation Switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Validity checking for reads of uninitialized data

    - Compilation switch ``-gnatVa`` enables validity checking

    - pragma :ada:`Initialize_Scalars` uses invalid default values

    - Compilation switch ``-gnateV`` enables validity checking for
      composite types (records, arrays) ⟶ extra checks to detect violation
      of SPARK stronger data initialization policy

- Non-aliasing checks for parameters

    - Compilation switch ``-gnateA`` enables non-aliasing checks between
      parameters

    - Does not apply to aliasing between parameters and globals


Test as Proof
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Feasibility of Exhaustive Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Exhaustive testing covers all possible input values

    - Typically possible for numerical computations involving few values

    - e.g. OK for 32 bits values, not for 64 bits ones

        - binary op on 16 bits ⟶ 1 second with 4GHz

        - unary op on 32 bits ⟶ 1 second with 4GHz

        - binary op on 32 bits ⟶ 2 years with 64 cores at 4GHz

    - In practice, this can be feasible for trigonometric functions on 32
      bits floats

- Representative/boundary values may be enough

    - Partitioning of the input state in equivalent classes

    - Relies on continuous/linear behavior inside a partition


Test on top of Proof
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Combining Unit Proof and Integration Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Unit Proof of AoRTE combined with Integration Test

    - Combination used by Altran UK on several projects

    - Unit Proof assumes subprogram contracts

    - Integration Test verifies subprogram contracts

- Unit Proof of Contracts combined with Integration Test

    - Test exercises the assumptions made in proof

    - One way to show Property Preservation between Source Code and
      Executable Object Code from DO-178C/DO-333

        - Integration Test performed twice: once with contracts to show
          they are verified in EOC, once without to show final executable
          behaves the same


Test Examples / Pitfalls
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Example #1
~~~~~~~~~~

I am stuck with an unproved assertion. My options are:

    - switch --level to 4 and --timeout to 360

    - open a ticket on GNAT Tracker

    - justify the unproved check manually

**Evaluation**: This approach is not correct. Why not, but only after
checking this last option:

    - run tests to see if the assertion actually holds


Example #2
~~~~~~~~~~

The same contracts are useful for test and for proof, so it’s useful to
develop them for test initially.

**Evaluation**: This approach is not correct. In fact, proof requires more
contracts that test, as each subprogram is analyzed separately. But these
are a superset of the contracts used for test.


Example #3
~~~~~~~~~~

Assertions need to be activated explicitly at compilation for getting the
corresponding run-time checks.

**Evaluation**: This approach is correct. Use switch ``-gnata`` to
activate assertions.


Example #4
~~~~~~~~~~

When assertions are activated, loop invariants are checked to be inductive
on specific executions.

**Evaluation**: This approach is not correct. Loop invariants are checked
dynamically exactly like assertions. The inductive property is not
something that can be tested.


Example #5
~~~~~~~~~~

Procedure ``P`` which is proved calls function ``T`` which is tested. To
make sure the assumptions used in the proof of ``P`` are verified, we
should check dynamically the precondition of ``T``.

**Evaluation**: This approach is not correct. The precondition is proved
at the call site of ``T`` in ``P``. But we should check dynamically the
postcondition of ``T``.


Example #6
~~~~~~~~~~

Function ``T`` which is tested calls procedure ``P`` which is proved. To
make sure the assumptions used in the proof of ``P`` are verified, we
should check dynamically the precondition of ``P``.

**Evaluation**: This approach is correct. The proof of ``P`` depends on
its precondition being satisfied at every call.


Example #7
~~~~~~~~~~

However procedure ``P`` (proved) and function ``T`` (tested) call each
other, we can verify the assumptions of proof by checking dynamically all
preconditions and postconditions during tests of ``T``.

**Evaluation**: This approach is not correct. That covers only functional
contracts. There are other assumptions made in proof, related to
initialization, effects and non-aliasing.


Example #8
~~~~~~~~~~

Proof is superior to test in every aspect.

**Evaluation**: This approach is not correct. Maybe for the aspects
:ada:`Pre` and :ada:`Post`. But not in other aspects of verification:
non-functional verification (memory footprint, execution time), match with
hardware, integration in environment... And testing can even be exhaustive
sometimes!


Example #9
~~~~~~~~~~

When mixing test and proof at different levels, proof should be done at
unit level and test at integration level.

**Evaluation**: This approach is not correct. This is only one possibility
that has been used in practice. The opposite could be envisioned: test
low-level functionalities (e.g. crypto in hardware), and prove correct
integration of low-level functionalities.


Example #10
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways to mix test and proof, and yours may not be in these
slides.

**Evaluation**: This approach is correct. YES! (and show me yours)
