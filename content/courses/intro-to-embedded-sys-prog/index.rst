.. container:: content-description

    This course will teach you the basics of the Embedded Systems Programming
    using Ada.

    This document was written by Patrick Rogers, with review by
    Stephen Baird, Tucker Taft, Filip Gajowniczek, and Gustavo A. Hoffmann.

    .. note::

        The code examples in this course use an 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
