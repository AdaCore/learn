About MISRA C
*************

The official website of the MISRA association https://www.misra.org.uk/ has
many freely available resources about MISRA C, some of which can be downloaded
after registering on the MISRA Bulletin Board at
https://www.misra.org.uk/forum/ (such as the examples from the MISRA C:2012
standard, which includes a one-line description of each guideline).

The following documents are freely available:

- `MISRA Compliance 2016: Achieving compliance with MISRA coding guidelines`,
  2016, which explains the rationale and process for compliance, including a
  thorough discussions of acceptable deviations

- `MISRA C:2012 - Amendment 1: Additional security guidelines for MISRA
  C:2012`, 2016, which contains 14 additional guidelines focusing on
  security. This is a minor addition to MISRA C.

The main MISRA C:2012 document can be purchased from the MISRA
webstore.

PRQA is the company that first developed MISRA C, and they
have been heavily involved in every version since then. Their webpage
http://www.prqa.com/coding-standards/misra/ contains many resources about
MISRA C: product datasheets, white papers, webinars, professional courses.

The PRQA Resources Library at
http://info.prqa.com/resources-library?filter=white_paper has some freely
available white papers on MISRA C and the use of static analyzers:

- An introduction to MISRA C:2012 at
  http://info.prqa.com/MISRA C-2012-whitepaper-evaluation-lp

- `The Myth of Perfect MISRA Compliance` at
  http://info.prqa.com/myth-of-perfect-MISRA Compliance-evaluation-lp,
  providing background information on the use and limitations of static
  analyzers for checking MISRA C compliance

In 2013 ISO standardized a set of 45 rules focused on security, available in
the `C Secure Coding Rules`. A draft is freely available at
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1624.pdf

In 2018 MISRA published `MISRA C:2012 - Addendum 2:
Coverage of MISRA C:2012 against ISO/IEC TS 17961:2013 "C Secure"`, mapping ISO
rules to MISRA C:2012 guidelines. This document is freely available from

About SPARK
***********

The e-learning website https://learn.adacore.com/ contains a freely available
interactive course on SPARK.

The SPARK User's Guide is available at
http://docs.adacore.com/spark2014-docs/html/ug/.

The SPARK Reference Manual is available at
http://docs.adacore.com/spark2014-docs/html/lrm/.

A student-oriented textbook on SPARK is `Building High Integrity Applications
with SPARK` by John McCormick and Peter Chapin, published by Cambridge University
Press. It covers the latest version of the language, SPARK 2014.

A historical account of the evolution of SPARK technology and its use in
industry is covered in the article `Are We There Yet? 20 Years of Industrial Theorem
Proving with SPARK` by Roderick Chapman and Florian Schanda, at
http://proteancode.com/keynote.pdf

The website https://www.adacore.com/sparkpro is a portal for up-to-date
information and resources on SPARK. AdaCore blog's site https://blog.adacore.com/
contains a number of SPARK-related posts.

The booklet `AdaCore Technologies for Cyber Security` shows how
AdaCore's technology can be used to prevent or mitigate the most common security
vulnerabilities in software. See
https://www.adacore.com/books/adacore-tech-for-cyber-security/.

The booklet `AdaCore Technologies for CENELEC EN 50128:2011` shows how
AdaCore's technology can be used in conjunction with the CENELEC EN 50128:2011
software standard for railway control and protection systems. It describes
in particular where the SPARK technology fits best and
how it can be used to meet various requirements of the standard. See:
https://www.adacore.com/books/cenelec-en-50128-2011/.

The booklet `AdaCore Technologies for DO-178C/ED-12C` similarly shows how
AdaCore's technology can be used in conjunction with the DO-178C/ED-12C
standard for airborne software, and describes in particular how SPARK
can be used in conjunction with the Formal Methods supplement DO-333/ED-216.

The blog post at
https://blog.adacore.com/MISRA-C-2012-vs-spark-2014-the-subset-matching-game
reviews the 27 undecidable rules in MISRA C:2012 and describes how SPARK
addresses them.

The white paper `A Comparison of SPARK with MISRA C and Frama-C` at
https://www.adacore.com/papers/compare-spark-MISRA-C-frama-c compares SPARK to
MISRA C and to the formal verification tool Frama-C for C programs.
