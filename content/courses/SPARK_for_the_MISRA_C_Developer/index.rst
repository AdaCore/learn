    This book presents the SPARK technology |mdash| the SPARK subset of Ada and
    its supporting static analysis tools |mdash| through an example-driven
    comparison with the rules in the widely known MISRA C subset of the C
    language.

    This document was prepared by Yannick Moy, with contributions and review
    from Ben Brosgol.
