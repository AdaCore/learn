.. container:: content-description

    This tutorial is an interactive introduction to the SPARK programming
    language and its formal verification tools. You will learn the difference
    between Ada and SPARK and how to use the various analysis tools that come
    with SPARK.

    This document was prepared by Claire Dross and Yannick Moy.

    .. info::

        The code examples in this course use a 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
