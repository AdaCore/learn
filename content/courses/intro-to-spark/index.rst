.. container:: content-description

    This tutorial is an interactive introduction to the SPARK programming
    language and its formal verification tools. You will learn the difference
    between Ada and SPARK and how to use the various analysis tools that come
    with SPARK.

    This document was prepared by Claire Dross and Yannick Moy.

    .. info::

        The code examples in this course use a 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.

        .. info::

            Each code example from this book has an associated "code block
            metadata", which contains the name of the "project" and a MD5 hash
            value. This information is used to identify a single code example.

            You can find all code examples in a zip file, which you can
            `download from the learn website <https://learn.adacore.com/zip/learning-ada_code.zip>`_.
            The directory structure in the zip file is based on the code block
            metadata. For example, if you're searching for a code example with
            this metadata:

            Project: Courses.Intro_To_Ada.Imperative_Language.Greet
            MD5: cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab

            you will find it in this directory:

            :file:`projects/Courses/Intro_To_Ada/Imperative_Language/Greet/cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab/`

            In order to use this code example, just follow these steps:

            1. Unpack the zip file;
            2. Go to target directory;
            3. Start GNAT Studio on this directory;
            4. Build (or compile) the project;
            5. Run the application (if a main procedure is available in the
               project).
