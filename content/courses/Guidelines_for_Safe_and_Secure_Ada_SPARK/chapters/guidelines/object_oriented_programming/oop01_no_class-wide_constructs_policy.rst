Description
+++++++++++++

In this approach, tagged types are allowed and type extension (inheritance) is
allowed, but there are no class-wide constructs.

This restriction ensures there are no class-wide objects or formal parameters,
nor access types designating class-wide types.

In this approach there are no possible dynamic dispatching calls because such
calls can only occur when a class-wide value is passed as the parameter to a
primitive operation of a tagged type.
