Description
+++++++++++++

Do not use an :ada:`others` choice in an extension aggregate. In :ada:`record`
and :ada:`array` aggregates,
do not use an :ada:`others` choice unless it is used either
to refer to all components, or to all but one component.

This guideline prevents accidental provision of a general value for a
:ada:`record` component or :ada:`array`
component, when a specific value was intended. This
possibility includes the case in which new components are added to an existing
composite type.
