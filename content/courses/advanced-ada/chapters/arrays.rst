Unconstrained Arrays
--------------------

.. admonition:: Relevant topics

    - Explain unbounded arrays. From "Introduction to Ada" course:

        > Although different instances of the same unconstrained array type can
        > have different bounds, a specific instance has the same bounds
        > throughout its lifetime. This allows Ada to implement unbounded
        > arrays efficiently; instances can be stored on the stack and do not
        > require heap allocation as in languages like Java.

    - Unconstrained vs. unbounded strings
