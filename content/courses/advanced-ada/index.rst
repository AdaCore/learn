    .. warning::

        **This is work in progress!**

        Information in this document is subject to change at any time without
        prior notification.  The editors/authors exclude all liability for the
        topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information
        provided in this course.

    .. note::

        The code examples in this course use a 50-column limit, which
        greatly improves the readability of the code on devices with a small
        screen size. This constraint, however, leads to an unusual coding
        style. For instance, instead of calling :ada:`Put_Line` in a single
        line, we have this:

        .. code-block:: ada

            Put_Line
              (" is in the northeast quadrant");

        or this:

        .. code-block:: ada

             Put_Line ("  (X => "
                       & Integer'Image (P.X)
                       & ")");

        Note that typical Ada code uses a limit of at least 79 columns.
        Therefore, please don't take the coding style from this course as a
        reference!

        .. note::

            Each code example from this book has an associated "code block
            metadata", which contains the name of the "project" and a MD5 hash
            value. This information is used to identify a single code example.

            You can find all code examples in a zip file, which you can
            `download from the learn website <https://learn.adacore.com/zip/learning-ada_code.zip>`_.
            The directory structure in the zip file is based on the code block
            metadata. For example, if you're searching for a code example with
            this metadata:

            - Project: Courses.Intro_To_Ada.Imperative_Language.Greet

            - MD5: cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab

            you will find it in this directory:

            :file:`projects/Courses/Intro_To_Ada/Imperative_Language/Greet/cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab/`

            In order to use this code example, just follow these steps:

            1. Unpack the zip file;
            2. Go to target directory;
            3. Start GNAT Studio on this directory;
            4. Build (or compile) the project;
            5. Run the application (if a main procedure is available in the
               project).


    This course will teach you advanced topics of the Ada programming language.
    The
    :doc:`Introduction to Ada </courses/intro-to-ada/index>`
    course is a prerequisite for this course.
