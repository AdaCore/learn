    This course introduce some guidelines to be aware of when connecting
    a C library to Ada. This connection is done by creating Ada constructs
    that map directly to C constructs, as well as the Ada compiler/linker
    information necessary to make the connection.

    Once this interface ("thin binding") has been created, this document
    will help you understand how to create "thick bindings" - Ada-aware
    wrappers to the thin bindings that allow you to use the full power
    of the Ada language to more safely interact with the C library.

    This course was written by Michael Frank and Olivier Henley,
    with a major assist from REDACTED from REDACTED Corporation.
