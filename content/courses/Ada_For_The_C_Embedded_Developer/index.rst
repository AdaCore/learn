.. container:: content-description

    This books introduces you to the Ada language by comparing it to C. It
    assumes that you have good knowledge of the C language. It also assumes
    that the choice of learning Ada is guided by considerations linked to
    reliability, safety or security. In that sense, it teaches you Ada
    paradigms that should be applied in replacement of those usually applied
    in C.

    This book also introduces you to the SPARK subset of the Ada programming
    language, which  removes a few features of the language with undefined
    behavior, so that the code is fit for sound static analysis techniques.

    This book was written by Quentin Ochem, Robert Tice, Patrick Rogers, and
    Gustavo A. Hoffmann.
