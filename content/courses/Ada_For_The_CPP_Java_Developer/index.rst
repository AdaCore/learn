.. container:: content-description

    This document will present the Ada language using terminology and examples
    that are familiar to developers that understand the C++ or Java languages.

    This document was prepared by Quentin Ochem, with contributions and review
    from Richard Kenner, Albert Lee, and Ben Brosgol.

    .. info::

        The code examples in this course use a 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
