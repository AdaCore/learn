.. container:: content-description

    This course describes how to implement selected programming idioms in
    the Ada language. Prior knowledge of Ada is required, although some
    explanations of the underlying semantics are provided when appropriate.

    This document was written by Patrick Rogers.

    .. note::

        The code examples in this course use an 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.

    .. only:: builder_latex or builder_epub

        .. note::

            Each code example from this book has an associated "code block
            metadata", which contains the name of the "project" and an MD5 hash
            value. This information is used to identify a single code example.

            You can find all code examples in a zip file, which you can
            `download from the learn website <https://learn.adacore.com/zip/learning-ada_code.zip>`_.
            The directory structure in the zip file is based on the code block
            metadata. For example, if you're searching for a code example with
            this metadata:

            - Project: Courses.Intro_To_Ada.Imperative_Language.Greet

            - MD5: cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab

            you will find it in this directory:

            :file:`projects/Courses/Intro_To_Ada/Imperative_Language/Greet/cba89a34b87c9dfa71533d982d05e6ab/`

            In order to use this code example, just follow these steps:

            1. Unpack the zip file;
            2. Go to target directory;
            3. Start GNAT Studio on this directory;
            4. Build (or compile) the project;
            5. Run the application (if a main procedure is available in the
               project).
