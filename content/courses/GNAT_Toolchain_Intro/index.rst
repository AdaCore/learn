    This course presents an introduction to the GNAT toolchain, which is
    included in the GNAT Community 2020 edition. The course includes first steps
    to get started with the toolchain and some details on the project manager
    (GPRbuild) and the integrated development environment (GNAT Studio).

    This document was written by Gustavo A. Hoffmann, with contributions and
    review from Richard Kenner and Robert Duff.

    .. info::

        The code examples in this course use a 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
