.. container:: content-description

    This course presents an introduction to the GNAT toolchain. The course
    includes first steps to get started with the toolchain and some details on
    the project manager (GPRbuild) and the integrated development environment
    (GNAT Studio).

    This document was written by Gustavo A. Hoffmann, with contributions and
    review from Richard Kenner and Robert Duff.

    .. note::

        The code examples in this course use an 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
