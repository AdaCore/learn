    This course presents an overview of the new features of the latest Ada 2022
    standard.

    This document was written by Maxim Reznik and reviewed by Richard Kenner.

    .. info::

        The code examples in this course use a 80-column limit, which is a
        typical limit for Ada code. Note that, on devices with a small screen
        size, some code examples might be difficult to read.
