GNAT Community
==============

.. include:: ../../global.txt

This chapter presents the steps needed to install the GNAT Community
toolchain and how to use basic commands from the toolchain.

Installation
------------

These are the basics steps to install GNAT Community on all platforms:

    - Go to the
      `AdaCore Community page <https://www.adacore.com/community>`_.

    - Download the GNAT installer.

    - Run the GNAT installer.

        - Leave all options checked on the "Select Components" page.

On Windows platforms, continue with the following steps:

    - Add ``C:\GNAT\2019\bin`` to your ``Path`` environment variable.

        - The environment variables can be found in the
          ``System Properties`` window of the ``Control Panel``.

    - You might need to restart your computer for the settings to take
      effect.

On Linux platforms, perform the following steps:

    - Make sure the GNAT installer has execution permissions before
      running it.

    - Select the directory where you want to install the toolchain.

        - For example: ``/home/me/GNAT/2019``

    - Add the path to the ``bin`` directory (within the toolchain
      directory) as the first directory in your ``PATH`` environment
      variable.

        - For example: ``/home/me/GNAT/2019/bin``.

Basic commands
--------------

Now that the toolchain is installed, you can start using it. From the
command line, you can compile a project using :program:`gprbuild`. For
example:

.. code-block:: sh

    gprbuild -P project.gpr

You can find the binary built with the command above in the *obj*
directory. You can the run it in the same way as you would do with any
other executable on your platform. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

    obj/main

A handy command-line option for :program:`gprbuild` you might want to use
is ``-p``, which automatically creates directories such as ``obj`` if they
aren't in the directory tree:

.. code-block:: sh

    gprbuild -p -P project.gpr

Ada source-code are stored in *.ads* and *.adb* files. To view the
content of these files, you can use the GNAT Programming Studio
(:program:`GPS`). To open :program:`GPS`, double-click on the *.gpr*
project file or invoke :program:`GPS` on the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

    gps -P project.gpr

To compile your project using :program:`GPS`, use the top-level menu to
invoke ``Build`` |srarr| ``Project`` |srarr| ``main.adb`` (or press the
keyboard shortcut ``F4``). To run the main program, click on
``Build`` |srarr| ``Run`` |srarr| ``main`` (or press the keyboard shortcut
``Shift + F2``).

Compiler warnings
-----------------

One of the strengths of the GNAT compiler is its ability to generate
many useful warnings. Some are displayed by default but others need to
be explicitly enabled. In this section, we discuss some of these
warnings, their purpose, and how you activate them.

``-gnatwa`` switch and warning suppression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sectionauthor:: Bob Duff

We first need to understand the difference between a *warning* and an
*error*. Errors are violations of the Ada language rules as specified
in the Ada Reference Manual; warnings don't indicate violations of
those rules, but instead flag constructs in a program that seem
suspicious to the compiler.  Warnings are GNAT-specific, so other Ada
compilers might not warn about the same things GNAT does or might warn
about them in a different way. Warnings are typically conservative;
meaning that some warnings are false alarms.  The programmer needs to study
the code to determine if each warning is describing a real problem.

Some warnings are produced by default while others are produced only if a
switch enables them. Use the ``-gnatwa`` switch to turn on (almost) all
warnings.

Warnings are useless if you don't do anything about them. If you give
your team member some code that causes warnings, how are they supposed
to know whether they represent real problems?  If you don't address
each warning, people will soon starting ignoring warnings and there'll
be lots of things that generates warnings scattered all over your
code.  To avoid this, you may want to use the ``-gnatwae`` switch to
both turn on (almost) all warnings and to treat warnings as
errors. This forces you to get a clean (no warnings or errors)
compilation.

However, as we said, some warnings are false alarms. Use
:ada:`pragma Warnings (Off)` to suppress those warnings. It's best to be as
specific as possible and narrow down to a single line of code and a single
warning. Then use a comment to explain why the warning is a false alarm if it's
not obvious.

Let's look at the following example:

.. code-block:: ada

    with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

    package body Warnings_Example is

       procedure Mumble (X : Integer) is
       begin
          Put_Line ("Mumble processing...");
       end Mumble;

    end Warnings_Example;

We compile the above code with ``-gnatwae``:

.. code-block:: none

    gnat compile -gnatwae ./src/warnings_example.adb

This causes GNAT to complain:

.. code-block:: none

    warnings_example.adb:5:22: warning: formal parameter "X" is not referenced

But the following compiles cleanly:

.. code-block:: ada

    with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

    package body Warnings_Example is

       pragma Warnings (Off, "formal parameter ""X"" is not referenced");
       procedure Mumble (X : Integer) is
       pragma Warnings (On, "formal parameter ""X"" is not referenced");

       --  X is ignored here, because blah blah blah...
       begin
          Put_Line ("Mumble processing...");
       end Mumble;

    end Warnings_Example;

Here we've suppressed a specific warning message on a specific line.

If you get many warnings of a specific type and it's not feasible to fix
all of them, you can suppress that type of message so the good warnings
won't get buried beneath a pile of bogus ones. For example, you can use the
``-gnatwaeF`` switch to silence the warning on the first version of
:ada:`Mumble` above: the ``F`` suppresses warnings on unreferenced formal
parameters.  It would be a good idea to use it if you have many of those.

As discussed above, ``-gnatwa`` activates almost all warnings, but not
all. Refer to the
`section on warnings <https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugn-docs/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn/building_executable_programs_with_gnat.html#warning-message-control>`_
of the GNAT User's Guide to get a list of the remaining warnings you
could enable in your project. One is ``-gnatw.o``, which displays
warnings when the compiler detects modified but unreferenced :ada:`out`
parameters. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: ada

    package Warnings_Example is

       procedure Process (X : in out Integer;
                          B :    out Boolean);

    end Warnings_Example;

.. code-block:: ada

    package body Warnings_Example is

       procedure Process (X : in out Integer;
                          B :    out Boolean) is
       begin
          if X = Integer'First or else X = Integer'Last then
             B := False;
          else
             X := X + 1;
             B := True;
          end if;
       end Process;

    end Warnings_Example;

.. code-block:: ada

    with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

    with Warnings_Example; use Warnings_Example;

    procedure Main  is
       X : Integer := 0;
       Success : Boolean;
    begin
       Process (X, Success);
       Put_Line (Integer'Image (X));
    end Main;

If we build the main application using the ``-gnatw.o`` switch, the
compiler warns us that we didn't reference the :ada:`Success` variable,
which was modified in the call to :ada:`Process`:

.. code-block:: none

    main.adb:8:16: warning: "Success" modified by call, but value might not be referenced

In this case, this actually points us to a bug in our program, since
:ada:`X` only contains a valid value if :ada:`Success` is
:ada:`True`. The corrected code for :ada:`Main` is:

.. code-block:: ada

    -- ...
    begin
       Process (X, Success);

       if Success then
          Put_Line (Integer'Image (X));
       else
          Put_Line ("Couldn't process variable X.");
       end if;
    end Main;

We suggest turning on as many warnings as makes sense for your
project. Then, when you see a warning message, look at the code and decide
if it's real. If it is, fix the code. If it's a false alarm, suppress the
warning. In either case, we strongly recommend you make the warning
disappear before you check your code into your configuration management
system.

Style checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GNAT provides many options to configure style checking of your code. The
main compiler switch for this is ``-gnatyy``, which sets almost all
standard style check options. As indicated by the
`section on style checking <https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugn-docs/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn/building_executable_programs_with_gnat.html#style-checking>`_
of the GNAT User's Guide, using this switch "is equivalent to
``-gnaty3aAbcefhiklmnprst``, that is all checking options enabled with the
exception of ``-gnatyB``, ``-gnatyd``, ``-gnatyI``, ``-gnatyLnnn``,
``-gnatyo``, ``-gnatyO``, ``-gnatyS``, ``-gnatyu``, and ``-gnatyx``."

You may find that selecting the appropriate coding style is useful to
detect issues at early stages. For example, the ``-gnatyO`` switch checks
that overriding subprograms are explicitly marked as such. Using this
switch can avoid surprises when you didn't intentionally want to override
an operation for some data type.  We recommend studying the list of coding
style switches and selecting the ones that seem relevant for your
project. When in doubt, you can start by using all of them |mdash| using
``-gnatyy`` and ``-gnatyBdIL4oOSux``, for example |mdash| and deactivating
the ones that cause too much *noise* during compilation.
